CROSSY ROAD

MY KNOWLEDGE GAPS
1) NEED TO LEARN CANVAS FUNCTIONALITY.
2) NEED TO BUILD A PERPETUAL GUI INTERFACE FOR GAMEPLAY... NOT SURE HOW TO DO THAT WITHOUT TYPING CODE AFTER CODE FOR THE ANIMATIONS.
3) FIRST TIME DOING MOTION BASED GAMES.

LOGIC
1) REQUIRE ONE PLAYER THAT CAN BE CONTROLLED BY KEYBOARD DIRECTIONAL KEYS ACROSS THE GAME BOARD. FRONT, BACK, LEFT, RIGHT.
2) NEED VERTICAL BLOCKS OF OBSTACLES FOR THE PLAYER TO NAVIGATE:
    2.1) BASE OBSTACLES: MOVING CARS OR OBJECTS.
    2.2) VARIED OBSTACLES: FASTER MOVING OBJECTS (BLOCKS) --> E.G. TRAINS, ETC
    2.3) WATER/LAVA OBSTACLES + SAFE PLATFORM (E.G. LOGS): PLAYER MUST JUMP ON THE LOGS. IF THEY END UP IN THE WATER --> GAME OVER.
    2.4) BARRIERS: BLOCKS(E.G. TREES AS BARRIERS ON NORMAL GROUND)
3) GAME DIFFICULTY NEEDS TO INCREASE AS MORE TIME HAS ELAPSED. (E.G. FASTER MOVING/MORE OBSTACLES OVER TIME)
4) PLAYER LOSES IF IT TOUCHES THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
5) PLAYER LOSES WHEN THEY 1) HIT ANY OBSTACLES IN 2.1 and 2.2 2) DROP IN THE WATER --> WHEN PLAYER TOUCHES BARRIERS IN 2.4, THEY WILL NOT LOSE, JUST CANNOT CROSS.
6) WE MUST TRACK PLAYER SCORE BY THE NUMBER OF STEPS THEY MOVE FORWARD VERTICALLY. SIDEWAYS DOES NOT COUNT.
7) THE GAME MUST SHOW THE SCORE IN THE INTERFACE AND STORE THE HIGH SCORE.
8) THE GAME CAN BE RESTARTED AT ANY TIME.
9) PAUSE FUNCTION SHOULD ALSO BE ADDED.
